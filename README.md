# Vaccine-Manager
Project for Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction
This project allows the input of vaccine doses and the management of their administration.
The goal is to build a vaccine and inoculation management system. To this end, your system should allow for the input of vaccine doses and the management of their administration.
Interaction with the program should occur through a set of lines composed of a letter (command) and a number of arguments depending on the command to be executed. You can assume that all input provided will respect the indicated types; for example, where a decimal integer value is expected, a letter will never be entered. The possible commands are listed in the following table and indicate the operations to be performed.

## Command Action

-q terminates the program

-c introduces a new batch of a vaccine into the system

-l lists the available vaccines

-a administers a dose of the vaccine to a user

-r removes the availability of a vaccine

-d deletes the vaccine application record

-u lists the applications to a user

-t advances the simulated time
